# clock
What I Learned
While making this digital clock : I learned how to work with JavaScript's Date object to retrieve and display the current time. I also practiced using setTimeout() for real-time updates and learned how to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better project structure and maintainability.


The feature I enjoyed building the most was the real-time clock update. Watching the time change every second using JavaScript felt satisfying and showed me how dynamic updates work in web development.

What I Would Add Next:
The current date below the time.
